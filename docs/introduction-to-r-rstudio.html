<br />
This workshop is motivated in part by the increasing need for tools that can be used to elucidate trends, decisions, and stories from data. Whether your data are generated via simulation, collected via a survey, observed in a scientific experiment, scraped from the web, etc, you need <em>software</em> to explore and construct inferences from these data. In this workshop, we’ll use the <strong>R</strong> statistical software. Why R?</p>
<ul>
<li>it’s free<br />
</li>
<li>it’s open source<br />
</li>
<li>it’s flexible / useful for a wide variety of applications<br />
</li>
<li>it has a huge online community<br />
</li>
<li>it can be used to create reproducible documents, apps, books, etc. (In fact, <em>this</em> document was constructed within RStudio.)</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
<br />
<strong>Workshop Outline &amp; Goals</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to provide a quick introduction to the power of and principles behind using R for statistical analysis. You will walk away with a solid foundation upon which you can build in utilizing R for your own research.</p>
<p><br />
Day 1:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Introduction to R &amp; RStudio</p></li>
<li><p>Data Visualization</p></li>
<li><p>Simple Statistics</p></li>
<li><p>Linear Regression</p></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Day 2:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Quantile Regression</p></li>
<li><p>Github in R</p></li>
<li><p>R Markdown</p></li>
<li><p>Principles of Reproducible Research reproducible research / outline for workshop</p></li>
</ul>
<p><br />

</p>
<div id="getting-started" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Getting Started</h2>
<p>Before the workshop, you were asked to download/update both R &amp; RStudio:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Download &amp; install R</strong>: <a href="https://mirror.las.iastate.edu/CRAN/" class="uri">https://mirror.las.iastate.edu/CRAN/</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Download &amp; install RStudio</strong>: <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/" class="uri">https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/</a><br />
Be sure to download the <em>free</em> version. Note that RStudio is an <em>integrated development environment (IDE)</em> for R, combining the power of R with extra automation tools.</p></li>
</ol>
<p> <br />
</p>
<p>Once you open RStudio, you’ll see four panes, each serving a different function:</p>
<p><img src="images/RStudioImage.001.jpg" height="450px" /></p>
<p> <br />
<br />
</p>
</div>
<div id="basic-features" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Basic features</h2>
<p><strong>Using R as a calculator</strong></p>
<p>We can use R as a simple calculator. Try the following:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="dv">2</span> +<span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">3</span>
<span class="dv">2</span> *<span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">3</span>
<span class="dv">2</span>^<span class="dv">3</span>
(<span class="dv">2</span> +<span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">3</span>)^<span class="dv">2</span>
<span class="dv">2</span> +<span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">3</span>^<span class="dv">2</span></code></pre></div>
<p> <br />
<br />
<strong>Comments</strong></p>
<p>Once you start saving your work, it’s helpful to <em>comment your code</em>. To this end, R ignores anything after <code>#</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="co">#calculate 3 squared</span>
<span class="dv">3</span>^<span class="dv">2</span></code></pre></div>
<p><br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Built-in functions</strong></p>
<p>R also includes built-in <em>functions</em> to which we supply <em>arguments</em>: <code>function(arguments)</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">sqrt</span>(<span class="dv">9</span>)

<span class="co">#the sum function calculates the sum of the listed numbers</span>
<span class="co">#does the order of arguments matter?</span>
<span class="kw">sum</span>(<span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dv">3</span>)
<span class="kw">sum</span>(<span class="dv">3</span>, <span class="dv">2</span>)

<span class="co">#what does the rep function do?  does the order of arguments matter?</span>
<span class="kw">rep</span>(<span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dv">3</span>)
<span class="kw">rep</span>(<span class="dv">3</span>, <span class="dv">2</span>)

<span class="co">#some arguments also have names</span>
<span class="kw">rep</span>(<span class="dt">x=</span><span class="dv">3</span>, <span class="dt">times=</span><span class="dv">2</span>)
<span class="kw">rep</span>(<span class="dt">times=</span><span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dt">x=</span><span class="dv">3</span>)

<span class="co">#is R case sensitive?  eg: can we spell rep as Rep? </span>
<span class="kw">Rep</span>(<span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dv">3</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p><br />
 <br />
</p>
<p><strong>Assignment</strong></p>
<p>We can assign &amp; store R output.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="co">#store the result of rep(3, 2) as TwoThrees</span>
TwoThrees &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">rep</span>(<span class="dv">3</span>, <span class="dv">2</span>)

<span class="co">#check out the results</span>
TwoThrees

<span class="co">#do something to the results</span>
TwoThrees +<span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">5</span>

<span class="co">#Names cannot include spaces!  try this:</span>
Two Threes &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">rep</span>(<span class="dv">3</span>,<span class="dv">2</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p><br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
</div>
<div id="getting-help" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Getting Help</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Curious about what happens if you change R code in some way? Try it! Playing around with a function is the best way to learn about its functionality.</p></li>
<li><p>Can’t remember the code you used in a past analysis? Search for it under the “History” tab in the upper right hand panel in RStudio.</p></li>
<li><p>Did you make a mistake and don’t want to retype all of your work? Use the up arrow! You can access &amp; subsequently edit any previous line of code by using the up arrow.</p></li>
<li>Don’t know what a certain function does or how it works? You have a couple of options:
<ul>
<li><p>Use <code>?</code> within RStudio to access help files.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">?rep</code></pre></div></li>
<li>Google!<br />
</li>
<li><p>There’s a massive RStudio community at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" class="uri">http://stackoverflow.com/</a>. If you have a question, somebody’s probably already written about it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<div id="working-with-data" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Working with data</h2>
<p>The following data were utilized in the fivethirtyeight.com article <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/">“The Dollar-And-Cents Case Against Hollywood’s Exclusion of Women”</a> which analyzes movies that do/don’t pass the <strong>Bechdel test</strong>. A movie passes the test if it meets the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>there are <span class="math inline">\(\ge 2\)</span> female characters<br />
</li>
<li>the female characters talk to each other<br />
</li>
<li>at least 1 time, they talk about something other than a male character</li>

<strong>Data Structure</strong></p>
<p><em>Tidy</em> data tables have two key features:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Each row represents a single <strong>observational unit</strong> of the sample.</p></li>
<li><p>Each column represents a <strong>variable</strong>, ie. an attribute of the cases.</p></li>
<li><p>The data are not treated like code. There are no extras - no row summaries, column summaries, data entry notes, comments, graphs, etc. All data manipulation should be done within R! All comments about the data collection, variables, etc should be provided in a separate <strong>code book</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><br />
Question: What are the units of observation in the above data? What are the variables?</p>
<p><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Accessing / Importing Data</strong></p>
<p>Data are stored in countless different locations (eg: your computer, Google drive, Wiki, etc) and in countless formats (eg: xls, csv, tables, etc). Luckily for us, the Bechdel data are already stored within R in the <code>fivethirtyeight</code> <strong>package</strong>. In general, packages developed &amp; shared by R users provide specialized functions and data. If you didn’t install the <code>fivethirtyeight</code> package before the workshop, you’ll need to do so now:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">install.packages</span>(<span class="st">&quot;fivethirtyeight&quot;</span>, <span class="dt">dependencies=</span><span class="ot">TRUE</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>Once you install the package, you can load the package in your R session and access the <code>bechdel</code> data:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">library</span>(fivethirtyeight)
<span class="kw">data</span>(bechdel)</code></pre></div>
<p>You can also access the <strong>codebook</strong> for these data:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">?bechdel</code></pre></div>
<p><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Examining Data Structure in R</strong></p>
<p>Before we do any data analysis we have to understand the structure of our data. Try the following.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="co">#view the data table in a separate panel</span>
<span class="kw">View</span>(bechdel)

<span class="co">#check out the first rows in the console</span>
<span class="kw">head</span>(bechdel)

<span class="co">#obtain the data dimensions: rows x columns</span>
<span class="kw">dim</span>(bechdel)

<span class="co">#get the variable names</span>
<span class="kw">names</span>(bechdel)</code></pre></div>
<p><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Examining Specific Variables</strong></p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="co">#to access a single variable use the $ notation</span>
bechdel$budget_2013
bechdel$clean_test
    
<span class="co">#we can determine the levels/categories of category variables</span>
<span class="kw">levels</span>(<span class="kw">factor</span>(bechdel$clean_test))
<span class="kw">levels</span>(<span class="kw">factor</span>(bechdel$binary))</code></pre></div>
<p><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Subsetting Specific Units of Observation</strong></p>
<p>We can obtain a subset of observations that satisfy a criterion defined by a variable within the data set:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="co">#subset of movies with a 2013 budget under 1 million dollars</span>
Cheap &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">subset</span>(bechdel, budget_2013&lt;<span class="dv">1000000</span>)
<span class="kw">dim</span>(Cheap)
<span class="kw">head</span>(Cheap)

<span class="co">#subset of movies that fail the test</span>
Failures &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">subset</span>(bechdel, binary==<span class="st">&quot;FAIL&quot;</span>)
<span class="kw">dim</span>(Failures)
<span class="kw">head</span>(Failures)

<span class="co">#subset of movies that EITHER have a budget under 1 million dollars OR fail the test</span>
CheapOrFail &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">subset</span>(bechdel, budget_2013&lt;<span class="dv">1000000</span> |<span class="st"> </span>binary==<span class="st">&quot;FALSE&quot;</span>)
<span class="kw">dim</span>(CheapOrFail)
<span class="kw">head</span>(CheapOrFail)

<span class="co">#subset of movies that BOTH have a budget under 1 million dollars AND fail the test</span>
CheapAndFail &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">subset</span>(bechdel, budget_2013&lt;<span class="dv">1000000</span> &amp;<span class="st"> </span>binary==<span class="st">&quot;FALSE&quot;</span>)
<span class="kw">dim</span>(CheapAndFail)
<span class="kw">head</span>(CheapAndFail)</code></pre></div>
<p>Some useful syntax for subsetting:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>&lt;</code> (less than), <code>&lt;=</code> (less than or equal to), <code>&gt;</code> (greater than), <code>&gt;=</code> (greater than or equal to), <code>==</code> (equal to)</p></li>
<li><p><code>&amp;</code> (and), <code>|</code> (or)</p></li>
</ul>
<p><br />
