All outputs should be generated from commands in your script. don’t do things by hand don’t point and click - save the commands that result instead All you really need is your data + code 3.2 How do be more reproducible in R 3.2.1 Organization Use R projects, open .Rproj file - working directory, git and github add ons Mindful file names &amp; directory organization - use relative paths in your scripts (folders for raw data, for scripts, for plots, for reports, etc) Order matters in a script 3.2.2 Documentation Document each command with human readable comments (Markdown is a great way to do this); include metadata at top of file so you know what each script is doing Use white space in your scripts (it’s free) Try to make your code human friendly (example of dplyr versus base R), sections 3.2.3 Transparency Load all necessary data and libraries at the very begining of your script, pacman Use relative paths - reference working directory, rather than the long computer path Set seed when doing any random number generation Do not save your Workspace! Tell R not to ask you. Clear console/environment/restart R often to check yourself If you save any outputs, make sure they are done by your script. ggsave(), png(), pdf() 3.2.4 Openness &amp; Long-Term Preservation Consider using packrat for package dependecy management Share your data and code as widely as possible - github, CRAN, archival repositories "]
