# Using R Reproducibly 


\

Most scientific work is **iterative**

The process between input and output needs to be **transparent** and **repeatable**.

## General Principles of Reproducibility

1. Don't do things by hand

* Difficult to track "point & click" edits
* May not be able to reverse errors (rounding, copy/paste, overwriting)
* Time consuming to redo

2. Automate where you can

* Repeatitive tasks are prone to errors (and are inefficient)
* R is useful for many automation tasks
  * file manipulation (file.create(), dir.create(), list.files(), file.copy(), write())
  * looping over mutiple files/items (for(), while())
  * vectorized functions (apply(), lappy(), Vectorize())

* paying attention to your inputs and outputs - all transformations should be done in the script. All outputs should be generated from commands in your script. 
* don't do things by hand
* don't point and click - save the commands that result instead
* All you really need is your data + code 


## How do be more reproducible in R
### Organization 
* Use R projects, open .Rproj file - working directory, git and github add ons
* Mindful file names & directory organization - use relative paths in your scripts (folders for raw data, for scripts, for plots, for reports, etc)
* Order matters in a script

### Documentation
* Document each command with human readable comments (Markdown is a great way to do this); include metadata at top of file so you know what each script is doing
* Use white space in your scripts (it's free)
* Try to make your code human friendly (example of dplyr versus base R), sections

### Transparency
* IF you point and click in RStudio, always PASTE command into script
* Load all necessary data and libraries at the very begining of your script, pacman
* Use relative paths - reference working directory, rather than the long computer path
* Set seed when doing any random number generation
* Do not save your Workspace! Tell R not to ask you. 
* Clear console/environment/restart R often to check yourself
* If you save any outputs, make sure they are done by your script. ggsave(), png(), pdf()

### Openness & Long-Term Preservation
* Consider using packrat for package dependecy management
* Share your data and code as widely as possible - github, CRAN, archival repositories
