# RWorkshop17

Post all workshop materials here.  

IF we choose to collate the materials into a single git book:

- If you're uncomfortable with R bookdown, simply drop your Rmd files (and any supporting images, etc) OUTSIDE the docs folder.  Someone will put these into the book later.  

- If you're comfortable with R bookdown:     
    Step 1: In RStudio start a new project.  FILE / New Project > Version Control > Git.  In dialog box, paste the repository address: https://github.com/IRSAAtUMn/RWorkshop17.git and then click "Create Project"
    Step 2: Pull the current materials from github.    
    Step 3: Create an Rmd for your chapter of the book.  The file should start with a number that indicates its order in the book.  For example the first Intro to R chapter is named "01-IntroToR.Rmd".   
    Step 4: "Build the book" and push the changes to the "docs" folder to github.
