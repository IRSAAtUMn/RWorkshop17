# RWorkshop17

Post all workshop materials here.  

IF we choose to collate the materials into a single git book, you can simply drop your Rmd files (and any supporting images, etc) OUTSIDE the docs folder.  Someone will put these into the book later.  Or, if you're comfortable with R bookdown, read the steps below.


1. In RStudio start a new project.  FILE / New Project > Version Control > Git.  In dialog box, paste the repository address: https://github.com/IRSAAtUMn/RWorkshop17.git and then click "Create Project" . 

2. Pull the current materials from github.     

3. Create an Rmd for your chapter of the book.  The file should be saved OUTSIDE the docs folder and start with a number that indicates its order in the book.  For example the first Intro to R chapter is named "01-IntroToR.Rmd".

4. "Build the book" by knitting the index file.   This will update the files in the "docs" folder of your project.    

5. Push changes to github.
